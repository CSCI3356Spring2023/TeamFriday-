# TeamFriday :)

## Hello world


## To get started 

After cloning go into the `/TeamFriday-/oursite/` directory and make sure to ```pip install django-crispy-forms``` [(docs)](https://django-crispy-forms.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html), otherwise you will run into an error when running the server.

## Running the server

In the ./oursite directory run ```python manage.py runserver```

## Editing CSS

Our styles.css file is located in `./oursite/main/static/`

## Editing HTML

Our main templates are located in `./oursite/main/templates/main`

## Notes
At the moment we only have a main app to render some styled templates, but we will add more apps to handle user registration and crud fuctionality for this delivery.
